| **`permissions`**    | String,Number,Array<String,Number> | true     |          | `permissions` can either be a string, eg: `"1234"`, a number, eg: `1234` or an array, which can contain permission ID strings as well as other arrays which contain permission ID strings/numbers, eg: `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]`. The items in deep/nested array indicate permission IDs which must all be granted to the user to be consider authorized, they act as "and". The items in the top array act as 'or', if any are granted to the user the user would be consider authorized. The example `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]` would be similar `'1234' |  | '2345' |  | ('3456' && '4567') |  | ('5678' && '6789')`

| **`loader`**         | Boolean,Node                       | false    | `true`   | When `true`, `BlockUi` will be used when loading the permissions. When a `node`, that node will be render instead of `BlockUi` when loading the permissions. When `false`, nothing will be render when loading the permissions.
|
| **`organizationId`** | String                             | false    |          | When present, the permission will be validated to ensure it is assigned to the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **`customerId`**     | String                             | false    |          | When present, the permission will be validated to ensure it is assigned to the customer.

The items in deep/nested array indicate permission IDs which must all be granted to the user to be consider authorized, they act as "and". The items in the top array act as 'or', if any are granted to the user the user would be consider authorized. The example `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]` would be similar `'1234' || '2345' || ('3456' && '4567') || ('5678' && '6789')`
