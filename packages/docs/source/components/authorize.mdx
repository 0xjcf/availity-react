#### Props

| Prop Name            | Types                                  | Required | Default  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------        | -------                                | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **`permissions`**    | String,Number,Array<`String`,`Number`> | true     |          | `permissions` can either be a string, eg: `"1234"`, a number, eg: `1234`, or an array, which can contain permission ID strings as well as other arrays which contain permission ID strings/numbers, eg: `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]`. The items in a nested array indicate permission IDs that must *all* be granted to the user to be considered authorized - they act as "AND". The items in the top of the array act as "OR" - if *any* are granted, the user is considered authorized. The example `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]` is similar to `'1234' OR '2345' OR ('3456' && '4567') OR ('5678' && '6789')`.
| **`loader`**         | Boolean,Node                           | false    | `true`   | When `true`, `BlockUi` is used when loading the permissions. When a `node`, that node is rendered instead of `BlockUi` when loading the permissions. When `false`, nothing is rendered when loading the permissions.
| **`organizationId`** | String                                 | false    |          | When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **`customerId`**     | String                                 | false    |          | When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the customer. Note: Cannot be used in combination with the `organizationId` prop                                                                                                                               |
| **`region`**         | String,Boolean                         | false    | `true`   | When a string, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the provided region. When true, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the current region.                                                                                                   |
| **`unauthorized`**   | Node                                   | false    | `null`   | The content that renders when the user *does not* have the permissions required.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`children`**       | Node                                   | true     | `null`   | The content that renders when the user *does* have the permissions required.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **`negate`**         | Boolean                                | false    | `false`  | Negate the authorization. If the user *does* have the permissions specified, they are considered "unauthorized" (shown the `unauthorized` prop content). If the user *does not* have the permissions specified, they are considered "authorized" (shown the `children` prop content) |

#### Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Authorize from '@availity/authorize';
// ... 
<Authorize permissions={['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]} organizationId="1495">
  {/* ... */}
</Authorize>
// ...
```

### useAuthorize
Hook which validates the user's permissions and returns whether the user is authorized.

#### Arguments

- **`permissions`**: String,Number,Array<`String`,`Number`>. Required.
  - **string/number**: The permission ID, eg: `'1234'` or `1234`
  - **array**: The array can contain permission ID strings as well as other arrays which contain permission ID strings/numbers, eg: `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]`. The items in a nested array indicate permission IDs that must *all* be granted to the user to be considered authorized - they act as "AND". The items in the top of the array act as "OR" - if *any* are granted to the user, the user is considered authorized. The example `['1234', '2345', ['3456', '4567'], ['5678', '6789']]` is similar to `'1234' || '2345' || ('3456' && '4567') || ('5678' && '6789')`.
- **`options`** Object. Optional. Additional options
  - **`organizationId`**: String. Optional. When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the organization.
  - **`customerId`**:  String. Optional. When present, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned to the customer. Note: Cannot be used in combination with the `organizationId` prop
  - **`region`**:  String or Boolean. Optional. Default: `true`. When a string, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the provided region. When true, the permission is validated to ensure it is assigned in the current region.

#### Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useAuthorize } from '@availity/authorize';
// ... 
export default () => {
  const [authorized,loading] = useAuthorized(["1234","5678"], {
    region: 'FL'
  })

  return authorized && <SomeAuthorizedComponent />
}
// ...
```
