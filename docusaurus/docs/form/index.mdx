Availity form components that are wired to be hooked up to formik

### Installation

```bash
npx install-peerdeps @availity/form --save
```

### Programmatically controlling the state of the form

See [Formik documentation](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik)

### Accessing form values using hooks

It can be helpful to understand the `formik` hook `useFormikContext()` for accessing values from the form. The documentation can be found [here](https://formik.org/docs/api/useFormikContext).

### Validation

See [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) and [@availity/yup](https://github.com/Availity/sdk-js/tree/master/packages/yup).

Currently, we recommend pinning the `yup` version to `0.31.1` to avoid bringing in some breaking changes from that project.

### Browser Compatibility! ( Internet Explorer )

In order for this library to be compatible with Internet Explorer, the following polyfills need to be provided. If you are on `@availity/workflow@6.0.0` or later, they are already provided for you.
